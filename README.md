## üõ†Ô∏è How to Set Up & Run Locally

To get HomeCareFix up and running on your local machine, follow these general steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/faizanSayyed7/HomeCareFix.git
    cd HomeCareFix
    ```

2.  **Set up a Local Web Server:**
    You'll need a local web server environment (like XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, or LAMP stack) that supports PHP and a database (e.g., MySQL).

3.  **Database Setup:**

      * Create a new database (e.g., `homecarefix_db`) in your MySQL/MariaDB.
      * Import any `.sql` files found in the `Sql/` directory into your newly created database. These files will set up the necessary tables and initial data.
      * Update database connection details (hostname, username, password, database name) in relevant PHP files (e.g., `config.php`, `db_connection.php`, or similar, which might be found in `component/` or `vendor/` or directly in core files).

4.  **Place Project Files:**
    Move all the project files into your web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).

5.  **Access the Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/HomeCareFix/` (or `http://localhost/` if you placed the files directly in the root).
